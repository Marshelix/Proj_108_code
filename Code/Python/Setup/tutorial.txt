Tutorial for setup.py:

Setup.py generates a settings datafile to be used for Project 108.
It works by employing a pandas dataframe, with the columns being the part of the project and the index being the line to use.
It has the following format:
	Email	Spherharg				NN
0 Sender    l0						unused so far
1 Addressee l1
2 URL:Port  Harmonics folder
3 password  Legendre folder
4 Login Acc Data folder
5 Timelimit unused
6 unused    unused

Herein, the Sender, Addresse and Login ACC for Email are the respective email addresses to log into an online email account.
The Timelimit is the time the program waits after sending a mail to send another one.

l0,l1 are parameters for the original Spherical harmonics generator. Currently, this is unused.
The Harmonics folder is the folder where the beforementioned harmonics would be saved to. This is currently unused.
The Legendre folder "    "  "      "      "          "       legendre function " " " ". This is currently unused
The data folder holds both the maps folder(which includes the saved maps and the images saved for checking), as well as the power file from Lambda.

Effectively, as long as you dont want to use the email part, you only need to set the location of Spherharg 4, the data folder.
The tool employs a cmd style structure, and allows the following commands:

set: usage: set column index value
read: usage: read column index 0 or read all 0 0
quit: usage: quit
save: usage: save 0 0 0 or save
